# Surge Synth - Custom config

Patches and other config for the open-source and super-powerful [Surge Synthesizer](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/)! Check that one out. If you enjoy **Serum**, **Vital** or the like, you'll definitely like this one!

Patches are at [`custom_user_data_folder/`](custom_user_data_folder/). I use them by just setting _Menu > Data Folders > Set Custom User Data Folder..._ to it. You can also just copy/load the particular patched from there too.

Enjoy!
